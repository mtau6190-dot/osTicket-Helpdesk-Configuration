<p>Online Banking: Created under *Admin Panel → Agents → Teams* to bring together agents from different departments into a single working group.  
  - **What:** A team is a cross‑department collection of agents who collaborate on specific ticket categories.  
  - **Why:** Teams improve flexibility by allowing agents with diverse skills to work jointly on specialized issues (e.g., online banking problems), ensuring faster resolution and better coverage than relying on a single department alone.</p>
